# VoiceThief

Educate those around you on the advancements of voice cloning technology, and how it can be used to have targeted phishing attacks.

Built for the Iowa State University Ivy Hackathon 2024. This project got 3rd place in the technical category, being one of/the only team of 1.

This project is fully an educational tool, and is not intended for anything but such. The current code is a proof of concept, being slightly modified from the submitted hackathon code (to allow for a demo by others). More setup instructions will come eventually, when I have time to improve on the code.
